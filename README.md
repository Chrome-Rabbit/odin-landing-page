# Landing Page - Odin Project

## Overview
This is my implementation of the second project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. The goal is to build a basic landing page using foundational HTML, CSS, and Git skills. It showcases a simple, functional webpage that features heavy use of CSS and Flexbox. If you would like to view the deployment then visit (https://chrome-rabbit.github.io/odin-landing-page/)

## Features
- **HTML Fundamentals**: Utilizes elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<a>`), attributes (e.g., `href`, `src`), and proper document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`).
- **CSS Styling**: Utilizes properties (e.g., display: flex, flex-direction: column, justify-content: space-around, align-items: center) with Flexbox for responsive layouts, alongside styling rules (e.g., font-size: 48px, border-radius: 25%, background-color: #1F2937) for visual design and consistency.
- **Nesting**: Organizes content with nested HTML elements, paired with CSS selectors (e.g., .section-1 img, .blue-box button), to ensure readability and maintainable structure.
- **Git Workflow**: Commits follow imperative mood convention, with version control integrated throughout development.

# Personal Reflection 
CSS was the easy part. In fact, I really like how it functions. However, flexbox was tough to grasp at first. Aligning elements certainly took some trial and error. But it clicked eventually, and now I’m confident in using it. Integrating CSS into this project feels natural now too. I can see it shaping my future work. This page shows I’ve grown and can keep building.
